## What We Do
The [Olin Robotics Lab](http://olinrobotics.github.io) is working to build a low-cost robotic coworker that can assist in workplace tasks and interact with other humans around it. Our goal is to create an intuitive and engaging interactive experience, so that anyone at any skill level can easily work with our robot.
